# TODO: Import the random module


# TODO: Create a list that contains 15 words (with varying lengths) as strings (use this to randomly 
# create the word_to_guess


# TODO: Define a function called `create_initial_hint` that takes one parameter:
# word_to_guess ( a list that represents the word to guess, for example: ['b','l','a','c','k']   )
# after processing the input the function should return the initial hint (for example
# given the above input the function should return  ['_','_','_','_','_'] )


# TODO: Define a function called `create_hint` that takes three parameters:
# word_to_guess ( a list that represents the word to guess, for example: ['b','l','a','c','k']   )
# hint( a list that represents the hint so far, for example:    ['b','_','a','_','_'] )
# guess ( a string that represents the guess, for example: 'c'
# after processing the input the function should return the hint (for example given 
# the above input the function should return ['b','_','a','c','_'])


# TODO After creating the above functions and verifying they work create the rest of the program using,
# among other things, a while loop
